Problem Description:
You are given the slope m and the y-intercept b of a line, 
along with a value x. Your task is to calculate and 
return the value of y using the equation of a line in slope-intercept form: y=mx+b

Input: Three floating-point numbers: slope, intercept, and x.

Output: A floating-point number representing the value of yyy corresponding to the given xxx.

Example:
Input: slope = 2, intercept = 3, x = 4
Output: 11.0
 
Input: slope = 1.5, intercept = -2, x = 2
Output: 1.0
