Problem Description:
You are given two integers, n and m. 
Your task is to return a rectangle pattern of '*', 
where n represents the number of rows (length) and m represents the number of columns (breadth).

Input:
Two integers n and m, where 1 <= n, m <= 100.

Output:
A list of strings where each string represents a row of the rectangle pattern.

Example:
Input: n = 4, m = 5
Output: ['*****', '*****', '*****', '*****']

Input: n = 3, m = 2
Output: ['**', '**', '**']
