'''
Problem Description:
You are given an integer n. 
Your task is to return an inverted right-angled triangle pattern of '*' 
where each side has n characters, represented as a list of strings. 
The first row should have n stars, the second row n-1 stars, and so on, until the last row has 1 star.

Input Parameters:
n (int): The height and base of the inverted right-angled triangle.

Output:
A list of strings where each string is a row of '*' characters that decreases in length from n to 1.

Example:
Input: 3
Output: ['***', '**', '*']
 
Input: 5
Output: ['*****', '****', '***', '**', '*']
