Problem Description:

You are given an integer n. 
Your task is to return a right-angled triangle pattern of '*' 
where each side has n characters, represented as a list of strings. 
The triangle has '*' characters, starting with 1 star in the first row, 2 stars in the second row, 
and so on until the last row has n stars.

Input Parameters:
n (int): The height and base of the right-angled triangle.

Output:
A list of strings where each string is a row of '*' characters that increases in length from 1 to n.



Example:
Input: 3
Output: ['*', '**', '***']
 
Input: 5
Output: ['*', '**', '***', '****', '*****']
